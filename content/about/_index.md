Title: About me
type: list
---

I am a Technical Account Manager currently working at Amazon Web Services. In my role, I serve as an advocate for customers, assisting them with their cloud journey while focusing on cost optimization and operational excellence.

Prior to becoming a TAM, I was part of the Linux team in AWS Support, where I worked on various AWS services to resolve complex customer issues. I troubleshot application deployments and recreated customer environments to diagnose problems. My responsibilities also included creating tutorials, how-to videos, and other technical articles for both internal and customer communities.

Before joining AWS, I worked at Avaya as part of the ASP 100 and 4200 product design and development R&D team. I was actively involved in the design, testing, and deployment of Avaya's ASP products. In my first role at Avaya, I managed the Highlands Ranch data center. My expertise includes data center administration, DevOps and automation, and cloud computing. I have also earned multiple cloud certifications from AWS and Microsoft Azure.

Prior to joining Avaya, I worked as a Network Engineering Intern at NRG Energy and Finger Lakes Technologies Group. These internship experiences helped me develop skills in customer support, network administration, hardware deployment, and system administration.

Before moving to the US, I worked as a System Administrator at HSBC Software India Pvt. Ltd., where I was involved in a security-related project focused on electronic communication surveillance.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics from the University of Mumbai and a Master's degree in Networking and System Administration from Rochester Institute of Technology, where I graduated with a 4.0 GPA.
